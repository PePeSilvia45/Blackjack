learning java trying to make a very simple blackjack dealer

through further development of the blackjack dealer i have now produced a black jack game which offers a range of real game functions including 
hitting, sticking, betting, doubling douwn on bets, and I am currently working on the abbility to split doubles into two hands.
Aces also = 1 or 11 as long as the user wont me busted by them. betting outcomes 2x for a win 2.5x for blackdack on deal 1x on matching the dealer.
